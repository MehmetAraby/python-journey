# 🐍 My Python Journey

Welcome to my personal Python learning repository!

This repo is a collection of everything I learn as I explore the world of Python — from basic syntax to advanced topics and small projects. It's a space where I practice, take notes, and experiment with code.

## 📚 What You'll Find Here

- 🧠 **Basics** — Variables, data types, conditionals, loops, etc.
- 🧮 **Functions & Modules** — Reusable blocks of code and custom modules.
- 📦 **Data Structures** — Lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples.
- 👨‍💻 **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)** — Classes, inheritance, encapsulation.
- 🛠️ **Mini Projects** — Real-world small applications for practice.
- 📝 **Notes & Tips** — Useful Python tricks, explanations, and resources.

## 🎯 Why I Made This

I wanted a place to:

- Track my progress.
- Practice what I learn.
- Build a portfolio of code as I improve.
- Stay consistent and motivated.

## 🚀 Goals

- ✅ Learn the fundamentals.
- ✅ Understand how Python works behind the scenes.
- ⏳ Build real projects.
- ⏳ Learn Python for web development / automation / data science *(choose your path)*.
- ⏳ Contribute to open-source Python projects.

## 📅 Started on `June 2025`

Let's grow with code, one line at a time. 💻✨
